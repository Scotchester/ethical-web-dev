# In conclusion

Thank you for taking the time to read “Building Web Apps that Work Everywhere.”

If throughout your reading you have come across things that are missing or could be improved, I would encourage you to contribute back to the book. This title is available as open source and contributions can be made by:

- Contributing directly to the GitHub repository with a pull request <https://github.com/ascott1/ethical-web-dev>.
- Creating an issue in the book’s GitHub repository <https://github.com/ascott1/ethical-web-dev/issues>.
- Reaching out to me through [email](mailto:adamdscott@protonmail.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adamdscott).

20% of the proceeds, from each Ethical Web Development title will be donated to an organization whose work has a positive impact on the issues described. For this title, I will be donating to the World Wide Web Foundation. The World Wide Web Foundation was established in 2009 by Web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee to advance the open Web as a public good and a basic right.

If you are interested in supporting the World Wide Web Foundation’s work please consider making a donation at [webfoundation.org/get-involved](http://webfoundation.org/get-involved/).

This title is part of a series of digital reports I am authoring on the subject of ethical web development. Other titles in the series will cover building web applications that work for everyone, building web applications that respect a user's privacy and security, and working with development peers. You can learn more about the series at <ethicalweb.org>.
