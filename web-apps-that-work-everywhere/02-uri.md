— [THE W3C](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html)

The humble link is the most fundamental building block of the web. The ability to connect to any page on the web with the click of a button is the driving force behind much of the web’s history. As developers we should aim to expose permanent, human readable, deep links to our users.

In 1996 the creator of the web, Tim Berners-Lee, drafted [Universal Resource Identifiers -- Axioms of Web Architecture](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Axioms.html). This document consists of several axioms of URI design, many technical in nature, but the first (and arguably most important) is “universality.” By Berners-Lee’s definition, “any resource anywhere can be given a URI” and “any resource of significance *should* be given a URI” (emphasis mine). By conforming to these expectations of the web we make it easier for our users to share and interact with the web. 

## URI Design

Simply Providing URL’s is the first step, but as Jakob Nielsen has described them [URLs are a form of user interface](https://css-tricks.com/guidelines-for-uri-design/). Even in the era of search results, a [study from Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=70395) to determine if URLs were observed by average users revealed that users spent 24% of their gaze time looking at the URLs in search results. With this in mind, how can we design URIs that are effective and usable?

### Keep URIs simple

Effective URIs are simple, short, and human-friendly. This makes them easier to type and remember for users.

WordPress is the most popular content manager for the web and powers roughly [X] percent of websites. Unfortunately, the default WordPress [permalink structure](https://codex.wordpress.org/Introduction_to_Blogging#Pretty_Permalinks) produces URIs such as:

```
/index.php?p=423
```

To a user this URI format is seemingly random and arbitrary. Thankfully, WordPress allows users to create “pretty” permalink structure, such as:

```
/posts/effective-altruism/
```

### Make URIs Meaningful and Consistent

URIs should be both meaningful and consistent throughout a site. Meaningful URIs clearly represent a resource and accurately describe its contents with the title and, when useful, keywords. A website that holds a blog may put blog posts within a `/blog/` URI structure such as `/blog/uri-design` and `/blog/ethical-web`. These URLs make the intent of the resource clear and are understandable to the user. URIs should also be consistent, using recognizable patterns. If when logged into an application my profile’s URL is `https://example.com/user/adamscott`, I would expect to find another user’s profile with the same URI structure of `/user/username`.

### Make URIs “Hackable”

URIs should be “hackable” up the tree of the URI in a way that allows users to visualize the site structure. For example, if a URL is `https://example.com/artist/albums/album-name/` changing the URL to `https://example.com/artist/albums/` would return a page displaying the artist’s albums and ``https://example.com/artist/` an artist page. Doing this makes our URIs more meaningful and predictable for our users, while allowing the, to navigate down the tree and share URLs in a

- Predictable. Human-guessable. If your URLs are meaningful they may also be predictable. If your users understand them and can predict what a url for a given resource is then may be able to go ‘straight there’ without having to find a hyperlink on a page. If your URIs are predictable, then your developers will argue less over what should be used for new resource types.
Help visualize the site structure. This helps make our URIs more predictable and navigable for our users.

By following these guidelines, we can design URIs for our applications that are both easy to navigate and share by our users.


### API URI Design

Often, when designing URIs we are not limited to designing them for end-users. APIs provide a URL interface for both internal and external developers when interacting with our services.

Much like HTML URLs, when design API URIs we should focus on permanence. As technology and services change, it is likely that our API will evolve. When exposing a public API, it is common practice to host our API on a subdomain named, API. This allows us to run our API in its own environment while tying it to our top level domain.

```
https://api.example.com
```

Perhaps one of the most important things we can do for permanence is to always include an API version in the URI. This allows us to adopt changes to our application’s technology and features while continuing to return results for past versions of the API. 

```
https://api.example.com/v1/
```

Use nouns to identify resources. This describes what the resource returns rather than what they do. This means that we should favor identifiers such as `users` instead of identifiers like `getUsers` or `list-users`. 

```
https://api.example.com/v1/users/
```

Similar to page URLs, APIs should work up and down the URI tree, making them “hackable.” If `/users/` returns a list of users `/users/username` should return the results for a specific username.

```
https://api.example.com/v1/users/
https://api.example.com/v1/users/psinger/
```

Lastly, our API should filter advanced results by query parameters. This allows us to keep the base of our URLs reasonably simple and clean while allowing for advanced filters and sorting requirements. 

```
/users/psinger/friends?sort=date
```

As API developers, the URI is our interface. By considering their permanence the design URIs we are building more useful and sustainable APIs.

## Permanent URLs

One of the beautiful things about developing for the web is the ability to evolve our applications over time, immediately deploying updates to every user. With this ability, however, we often introduce states of fluctuation as we change server configurations, undergo content redesigns, and adapt to new technologies and frameworks. We should avoid arbitrarily changing URIs for our applications as much as possible. When significant changes to content require a URL change, we should always forward the previous URL to the new page.

When creating permanent URL’s the first step is to ensure that technology does not dictate the URL. Often sites display language filetypes at the end of a URL such as `.php` or `.asp`.  This doesn’t accommodate for future iterations of an application that may be built upon a different technology stack. By remaining technology independent in URI design we take the first step towards more permanent URLs.

The importance or persistent URLs is that they help to preserve the web. When URLs persist, outside links remain active, user bookmarks remain relevant, and information remains consistent. By focusing on good URI design we can help to ensure the permanence of URLs across the web.

> Report canonical URIs. If you have two different URIs for the same resource, ensure you put the canonical URL in the response.


## Sharable URLs

Commenting on an early draft of the Principles for Ethical Web Development, [Dean Marano](https://github.com/deanmarano) raised the important issue of creating sharable URL’s.

> One thing that for me is very important when building apps is the ability to share a URL - either with myself or with others - easily. By leveraging this built in feature of the web, it makes it much easier to share, bookmark, and be a good web citizen.

This ability to link and share is a key advantage that web development has over other forms of application development. A few ways that we can aid this practice in our applications, is to give our users the ability to link out to content that is within our applications, without requiring a login when possible, ensuring that URLs are updated when doing client-side routing, and by avoiding non-standard URL formats such as hash-bang URLs (`http://example.com/#!/foo/`).
