## File size

As of writing, the average web page requires a user to download roughly 2.3MB worth of data[^1]. Using this metric, the first 5.25 inch hard drive, the 1980 Seagate ST-506, would be able to hold just two modern web pages.

With varying connection speeds around the world, the cost of accessing our site’s can differ. The tool [What does my site cost?](https://whatdoesmysitecost.com) seeks to provide insight into the real-world data costs of sites accessed over a mobile connection.

Here is the cost of a few different sites when accessed in various parts of the world:

To decrease the footprint of our websites, we can aim to:

1. Minimize the number of resources
2. Optimize files, images, and fonts
3. Serve responsive images
4. Leverage gzip and caching

By putting these four best practices in action, we ensure that our site’s users are transferring the lowest amount of data from our servers to their devices.

### Number of Resources

Perhaps the biggest impact we can have on reducing data transfer for first time users is to limit the number of resources sent to the user. Each individual resource on a page requires an individual HTTP request. A waterfall chart, such as the ones found in Chrome’s developer tools, shows how long it takes to download each resource.

![Image of Google Chrome’s Network waterfall chart](img/waterfall.png)

To reduce the number of requests a browser makes, it is common to bundle files together. We can achieve this through techniques such as bundling CSS and JavaScript into single files and the use of image sprites.

### http2 

#### The Four Pre’s (Prefetch, Preconnect, Prerender, Preload)

In addition to reducing the number of resources, we can make use of several techniques to prefetch the content we need. I call these “The Four Pre’s” (prefetch, preconnect, pretender, and preload) and each can be useful in a different context where we may want to instruct the browser to download a resource before it is needed. This allows us, as developers, to give further instruction to the browser about the resources our users will need.

##### Prefetch

Prefetch allows us to request that the browser resolves a DNS lookup for another host that the browser will access. This is really useful when loading things such as third party scripts.

To use prefetch we add a `link` tag to the `<head>` of our HTML page.

```
<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="//example.com">
```

We can also prefetch specific resources

```
<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="example.com/style.css">
```

##### Preconnect

Preconnect works much like prefetch, but also performs the TCP handshake and negotiates the TLS tunnel if needed. 

```
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://example.com">
```

##### Prerender

Prerender allows us to preload all of the assets at a given URL.  

> This is like opening the URL in a hidden tab – all the resources are downloaded, the DOM is created, the page is laid out, the CSS is applied, the JavaScript is executed, etc. If the user navigates to the specified href, then the hidden page is swapped into view making it appear to load instantly.

```
<link rel="prerender" href="http://example.com“>
```

##### Preload

Preload is a new [browser specification](https://w3c.github.io/preload/) that, as of writing, is only available in Chrome 50+, Opera 37+, and modern Android browsers[^2]. As the specification describes preload, there are currently

> cases where some resources need to be fetched as early as possible, but their processing and execution logic is subject to application-specific requirements - e.g. dependency management, conditional loading, ordering guarantees, and so on. Currently, it is not possible to deliver this behavior without a performance penalty.


```
<link rel="preload" href="/styles/other.css" as="style">
```

### Optimizing Files, Images, and Fonts

Once we have reduced the number of http requests being made in our site, the next step is to optimize the files we server. We can do this by minimizing CSS and JS resources, optimizing and and serving proper images, and making good use of web fonts when used.

#### Minimizing Files

Though white space and line breaks make CSS and JavaScript files readable to humans, they are necessary for the browser to properly parse them. To reduce the file size of these resources we should minimize them for our production sites.

There are several desktop and web applications for minimizing CSS and JavaScript.

- [Closure Compiler](https://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home) - An online tool from Google for minifying JavaScript
- [Online JavaScript/HTML/CSS Compressor](http://refresh-sf.com/) - A single web interface for compressing three file types.
- [Smaller](http://25.io/smaller/) - A Mac OS X tool for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript compression.
- [UglifyJS](http://marijnhaverbeke.nl//uglifyjs) - An online tool for JavaScript minification based on the popular Uglify.js utility.

Desktop and web tools may be great for simple sites or those that aren’t updated frequently, but to minimize effort we can integrate minification into a build process for our site. How this is done may depend on your site’s stack, Ruby on Rails, for example, has an [asset pipeline](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html) for the minification of assets. A common cross-framework approach is to use a build tool such as [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), or [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts). For these build tools there are a number of minification plugins. Here are a few that I’ve used with success in the past:

- [node-minify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-minify) - A Node interface for minifying both CSS and JavaScript, which utilizes a number of popular compression algorithms.
- [uglify-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglify-js) - A command line utility, written in JavaScript, for minifying JavaScrip.
- **Gulp**: [gulp-clean-css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-clean-css) - A css minification plugin for Gulp.
- **Gulp**: [gulp-uglify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-uglify) - A JavaScript minification plugin for Gulp.
- **Grunt**: [grunt-contrib-cssmin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-contrib-cssmin) - A CSS minification plugin for Grunt.
- **Grunt**: [grunt-contrib-uglify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-contrib-uglify) - A JavaScript minification plugin for Grunt.

#### Images

Images comprise the largest file sizes on a typical web page. [ADD COOL STAT]. By using images well and reducing their file sizes, we can significantly reduce the bandwidth they consume.
To do this we should use the proper image formats, optimize images to reduce file size, and serve the image size needed by the browser.

When creating images, we need to consider their content and choose the most appropriate format. 

- **JPG**: Use for photographs.
- **PNG**: Use as the default for most other static images and images that require transparency.
- **GIF**: Use for simple images. Supports transparency and animation.
- **SVG**: Small file size that scales well and is supported all modern browsers and Internet Explorer 9+.

Once we have chosen the proper file format for an image, we should optimize the image file. Optimizing reduces the file size of an image by applying compression and removing unnecessary information such as metadata, embedded thumbnails, and color profiles. There are a number of desktop and online tools that you may use to manually optimize images:

- [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com)
- [imagemin-app](https://github.com/imagemin/imagemin-app)
- [PNG Gauntlet](http://pnggauntlet.com/)
- [Tiny PNG](https://tinypng.com/)
- [ImageAlpha](https://pngmini.com/)
- [JPEG-Optimizer](http://www.jpeg-optimizer.com/)

For sites using a front-end build process, such as Gulp, Grunt, or npm scripts we can bake image optimization into our build process. The node package [imagemin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/imagemin) provides a utility for minimizing images in a number of build environments:

- **Command line interface:** [imagemin-cli](https://github.com/imagemin/imagemin-cli)
- **Gulp**: [gulp-imagemin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-imagemin)
- **Grunt:** [grunt-contrib-imagemin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-contrib-imagemin)

#### Responsive Images

Serve different image sizes at different viewport widths (responsive images)


#### Web Fonts

> Some browsers will wait a predetermined amount of time (usually three seconds) for the font to load before they give up and show the text using the fallback font-family. But just like a loyal puppy, WebKit browsers (Safari, default Android Browser, Blackberry) will wait forever (okay, often 30 seconds or more) for the font to return. This means your custom fonts represent a potential single point of failure for a usable site.

       url('/fonts/myfont.eot') format('eot');
}
```


### Gzipping and Caching

Though we may optimize our files locally, we can also configure our server to ensure that files are served efficiently to our users. Two common and effective approaches are the use of gzip and caching.


#### Gzip

Gzipping is a server configuration that replaces repetitive strings with pointers to a previous instance of the string. Using Gzip dramatically decreases file sizes, far more so than minification alone. In the article [The Difference Between Minification and Gzipping](https://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-minification-and-gzipping/), Chris Coyier points out the difference in file sizes in the Bootstrap CSS file:

- Original CSS file: 147kb
- Minified CSS file: 123kb (83% of the original file)
- Gzipped CSS file: 22kb (15% of the original file)
- Gzipped and minified CSS file: 20kb (14% of the original file)

Enabling Gzipping is done as part of our server configuration. HTML5 Boilerplate offers [configurations](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs) for popular servers including Apache, IIS, and Nginx, which include gzipping.

Here is what the Apache 2 configuration, set to gzip HTML, CSS, and JavaScript would look like:

```
<IfModule mod_filter.c>
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE “text/html” \
                                “text/css” \
                                “application/javascript”
</IfModule>
```

For a look at a complete `.htaccess` with additional file types, see the [HTML5 Boilerplate Apache configuration](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache/blob/master/dist/.htaccess#L740-L774).


#### Caching

Caching allows us to temporarily store previously accessed resources such as HTML, JS, CSS, and images locally for our users. This means that instead of relying on bandwidth, a users browser is able to immediately access the needed resource. In his [Caching Tutorial](https://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/) Mark Nottingham notes the two reasons that Web caches are used:

> - **To reduce latency** — Because the request is satisfied from the cache (which is closer to the client) instead of the origin server, it takes less time for it to get the representation and display it. This makes the Web seem more responsive.
> - **To reduce network traffic** — Because representations are reused, it reduces the amount of bandwidth used by a client. This saves money if the client is paying for traffic, and keeps their bandwidth requirements lower and more manageable.

In his article [Caching Best Practices & Max-Age Gotchas](https://jakearchibald.com/2016/caching-best-practices/), Jake Archibald described the two best practice patterns for caching:

1. Immutable content with a long max-age
2. Mutable content that is always server revalidated

For our purposes, we’ll focus on immutable content with a long max-age, though I encourage you to read Jake’s excellent article. There are two key components when following the immutable content with a long max-age caching practice. The first is the server setup. Again, using HTML5 Boilerplate’s [server configurations](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs) as an exemplar we can look at setting [mod_expires](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_expires.html) in Apache.

```
<IfModule mod_expires.c>
    ExpiresActive on
    ExpiresDefault                              "access plus 1 month"
    ExpiresByType text/css                      "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType text/html                     "access plus 0 seconds"
    ExpiresByType text/javascript               "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/png                     "access plus 1 month"
    ExpiresByType application/font-woff2        "access plus 1 month"
</IfModule>
```

**Note**: This an abbreviated example for demonstrative purposes. For the full list see HTML5 Boilerplate’s [.htaccess file](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache/blob/master/dist/.htaccess#L836).

As you can see, we’ve given many of our resources long cache life cycles. For CSS and JavaScript the caching extends to a year. However, when we update our site is unlikely that we would want users to experience a cached version of one of these resources. To avoid this, we need to bust the cache by changing the URL. The clearest way to do this is to append a hash to our resources. Rather than:

```
<script src="script.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
<img src="logo.png" alt="…">
````

We will want to serve:

```
<script src="script-273c2cin3f.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles-d41d8cd98f.css".css">
<img src="logo-115r1hss9h.png" alt="">
````

There are several tools to automate this process, depending on your framework and build processes:

- [gulp-rev](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-rev) - a Gulp task for static asset revisiting.
- [Django ManifestStaticFilesStorage](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/contrib/staticfiles/#manifeststaticfilesstorage) - A Django setting for appending a MD5 hash to the name of static files.
- [Rails config.assets.digest](what-is-fingerprinting-and-why-should-i-care-questionmark) - A Rails setting for appending a hash to static file assets. This is enabled in production environments by default.
- [static-asset](https://www.npmjs.com/package/static-asset) - A static asset manager for Node.JS, designed for Express.

## Testing Performance

Though we may follow a number of best practices for web performance within our application, it is useful to test and evaluate our site’s performance. We can measure performance while simulating devices and network conditions to provide us with a better understanding of how our site performs. 

### Dev Tools

When developing locally, we can begin testing performance using our browser’s developer tools. Using Google Chrome, we can load our site, open DevTools, click the Network tab, and perform a hard refresh (Ctrl + F5, Windows and Linux; Cmd + Shift + R, Mac). As the page loads, we can see a waterfall chart of the assets loaded on our page.

![Image of Network tab](img/network-tab.png)

The Network tab also provides us with the option to simulate throttled data networks. This gives us the opportunity to use our applications under varying network conditions, getting a sense of how functional they are when assets load at a slower rate and allowing us to build empathy for users who access our tools under less ideal conditions.

### WebPagetest

[WebPagetest](http://www.webpagetest.org) is web-based tool that allows us to examine the performance of a site with various browsers and network conditions. To begin using WebPagetest, we need only to visit the site and add a URL. The results of the test will provide data about our site’s load time.

One of the useful features WebPagetest provides is an overview chart containing information around load time for initial visits and repeat views to the site.

![WebPagetest chart of load times](img/load-time.png)

Another useful feature is a filmstrip view of the site’s progress when loading. This allows us to see more clearly the initial render of the page and how resources are loaded in the DOM.

![WebPagtest filmstrip view](img/filmstrip.png)

Using these features we are able to create metrics to measure the performance of our site and compare performance improvements throughout development.

WebPagetest is an [open source tool](https://github.com/WPO-Foundation), making it possible to contribute to its development as well as host your own instance, which can be valuable for testing sites before they are publicly available.
