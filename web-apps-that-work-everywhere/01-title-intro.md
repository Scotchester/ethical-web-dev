The ethics of a web that works everywhere

> Building massive, resource-heavy sites means excluding millions of users that have only ever known the web by way of feature phones or slightly better—users paying for every kilobyte they consume; users that already have to keep tabs on which sites they need to avoid day-to-day because of the cost of visiting them. I don’t mean some nebulous hand-wavy “bandwidth cost,” either—I mean actual economic cost.


> According to Akamai’s Q4 2015 rankings, the average Internet speed worldwide is at whooping 5.6mb/s. The global connectedness is rapidly growing, but there’s still a vast space of unmapped territories (for more insight into Internet penetration see [Global Internet Maps](http://www.internetsociety.org/map/global-internet-report/)).
