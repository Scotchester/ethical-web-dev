# In conclusion

Thank you for taking the time to read “Build Web Apps Together.” I hope that through reading this title you see value in building an inclusive developer environment that focuses on quality and takes advantage of the open source community. These encompass a small portion of the work we can do as web developers to ensure that the web is an open and accessible space for all users. My hope is that you now feel empowered and excited to build applications in this way.

If throughout your reading you have come across things that are missing or could be improved, I would encourage you to contribute back to the book. This title is available as open source and contributions can be made by:

- Contributing directly to the GitHub repository with a pull request <https://github.com/ascott1/ethical-web-dev>.
- Creating an issue in the book’s GitHub repository <https://github.com/ascott1/ethical-web-dev/issues>.
- Reaching out to me through [email](mailto:adamdscott@protonmail.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adamdscott).

Twenty percent of the proceeds from each Ethical Web Development title will be donated to organizations whose work has a positive impact on the issues described. For this title, I will be donating to the [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/) and [Girl Develop It](https://www.girldevelopit.com/). Mozilla is a non-profit organization which provides software, documentation, and education for the open web. Girl Develop It offers classes and community support for women of diverse backgrounds who are interested in learning web and software development.

If you've enjoyed this title, I hope that you'll join me in supporting these two great organizations.

This title is the first in a series of digital reports I am authoring on the subject of ethical web development. Future titles in the series will cover building web applications that work everywhere, building web applications that respect a user's privacy and security, and working with development peers. You can learn more about the series at [ethicalweb.org](https://ethicalweb.org).
