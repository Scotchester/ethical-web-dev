## De-identification

Though avoiding the tracking of users completely is preferred, there may be instances where this choice is outside of our control as web developers. In these cases, we should ensure that any collected user data is de-identified, ensuring that the privacy of our users remains intact. The goal of any de-identification is to ensure that any collected data cannot be used to identify the person who created the data in any way.

However, de-identification is not without its limitations, as de-identified data sets can be paired with other data sets to identify an individual. In the paper [No silver bullet: De-identification still doesn't work](http://randomwalker.info/publications/no-silver-bullet-de-identification.pdf) Arvind Narayanan and Edward W. Felten explore the limits of de-identification. Cryptographic techniques such as [differential privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy) can be used as another layer to help to ensure that individual users cannot be identified within collected datasets.
