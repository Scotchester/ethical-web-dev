Online privacy and security is a common point of concern among many people. Government surveillance, corporate tracking, and data leaks have become common news stories. In a [2016 Pew Research study](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/01/20/the-state-of-privacy-in-america/) on the state of privacy in America, it was found that few Americans are confident in the security or privacy of our data.

> Americans express a consistent lack of confidence about the security of everyday communication channels and the organizations that control them – particularly when it comes to the use of online tools. And they exhibited a deep lack of faith in organizations of all kinds, public or private, in protecting the personal information they collect. Only tiny minorities say they are “very confident” that the records maintained by these organizations will remain private and secure.

In 2016 the writer Walter Kirn wrote about the state of modern surveilance in the Atlantic magazine in an article titled [If You’re Not Paranoid, You’re Crazy](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/11/if-youre-not-paranoid-youre-crazy/407833/). The online version of the article, hosted on the Atlantic's website, contains at least 17 detected user trackers. Even when we are discussing tracking, we are creating data that is being tracked.

Despite the rise of concern, we live more and more of our lives digitally. In the article [With Great Data Comes Great Responsibility](https://medium.com/@jazzpazz/with-great-data-comes-great-responsibility-72d3e1c94e27#.twfg85eus) Pascal Raabe eloquently describes the way our digital data represents our lives:

> I’ve talked about data and how it now defines our identity and our memories. We’re now producing more data on a daily basis than through all of history. The digital traces we’re leaving behind with every click, every tweet and even every step that we make create a time machine for ourselves. These traces of our existence form the photo album of a lifetime. We don’t have to rely on memory alone but can turn to technology to augment our biological memories and virtually remember everything.


In this title, I hope to explore ways that, as web developers, we can work to maintain the privacy and security of our user's data. The four main concepts of this title are:

1. Respecting user privacy settings
2. Encrypting user connections with our sites
3. Working to ensure the security of our user's information
4. Providing a means for users to export their data
