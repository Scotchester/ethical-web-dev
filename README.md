# Ethical Web Development

As web developers, we are responsible for shaping the experiences of user's online lives. By making choices that are ethical and user-centered, we create a better web for everyone.

In Tim Berners-Lee's [The World Wide Web: A very short personal history](https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/ShortHistory.html), he states:

> The dream behind the Web is of a common information space in which we communicate by sharing information. Its universality is essential: the fact that a hypertext link can point to anything, be it personal, local or global, be it draft or highly polished. There was a second part of the dream, too, dependent on the Web being so generally used that it became a realistic mirror (or in fact the primary embodiment) of the ways in which we work and play and socialize. That was that once the state of our interactions was on line, we could then use computers to help us analyse it, make sense of what we are doing, where we individually fit in, and how we can better work together.

We have the opportunity to drive that vision of a universal web for everyone forward.

_Ethical Web Development_ will be a series of short digital books that explore the ethics of practical development topics. The books will be released throughout 2016 and early 2017 as free downloads from [O'Reilly](http://www.oreilly.com/).
